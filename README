- ctable.sty provides commands to easily typeset centered or left or
  right aligned tables and (multiple-)figure floats, with footnotes.
  Instead of an environment, a command with 4 arguments is used; the
  first is optional and is used for key,value pairs generating
  variations on the defaults and offering a route for future
  extensions.
