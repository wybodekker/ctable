This is version 1.16 of the ctable package
License: LPPL

ctable.sty provides commands to easily typeset centered or left or
right aligned tables and (multiple-)figure floats, with footnotes.
Instead of an environment, a command with 4 arguments is used; the
first is optional and is used for key,value pairs generating
variations on the defaults and offering a route for future
extensions.
