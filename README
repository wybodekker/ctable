This is version 1.21 of the ctable package
License: LPPL

ctable.sty provides commands to easily typeset centered or left or
right aligned tables and (multiple-)figure floats, with footnotes.
Instead of an environment, a command with 4 arguments is used; the
first is optional and is used for key,value pairs generating
variations on the defaults and offering a route for future
extensions.

changes of v1.20 relative to v1.19:
- added (for \setupctable only) these options related to the sideways option:
