Short description:
ctable.sty provides commands to easily typeset centered or left or right
aligned table and (multiple-)figure floats, with footnotes. Instead of an
environment, a command with 4 arguments is used; the first is optional and
is used for key,value pairs generating variations on the defaults and
offering a route for future extensions.
